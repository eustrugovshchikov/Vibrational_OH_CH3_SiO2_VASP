## Theory

This script extracts vibrational frequencies by applying a Fourier transform to the time‑series data of atomic trajectories generated by VASP molecular dynamics (MD) runs. In brief:

1. **MD Trajectory Output**  
   - Perform a VASP MD simulation and configure XDATCAR to write every ionic step.  
   - Ensure periodic snapshots of Si, O, H, and C atom positions are saved to XDATCAR file.

2. **Signal Preparation**  
   - Select only the OH and CH₃ atoms (by their indices) from the trajectory frames.  
   - Compute displacements for each bond vector as a function of time.

3. **Fourier Transform**  
   - Apply a discrete Fourier transform (via NumPy’s FFT) to each time‑series.  
   - Convert frequency‑domain amplitudes into power spectra, yielding peaks at characteristic vibrational modes.

4. **Spectrum Assembly**  
   - Combine individual group spectra, normalize intensity, and output as text.

## Installation
   - Python 3.x (≥ 3.6)  
   - No external Python dependencies beyond the standard library.

## Global Variables

Control analysis behavior via user-defined variables in your environment or `submit.sh` file.

```bash
# ***** USER-DEFINED VARIABLES *****
# Set simulation frame range (modify these numbers before submission)
START_FRAME=5000
FINISH_FRAME=100000
# ***********************************

# Based on the command-line argument (1,2,3,4), the script outputs:
#  1) Mode 1 (only OH): Bonds: H–O and O–Si, Angle: H–O–Si.
#  2) Mode 2 (only CH3): Bonds: C–H (for each H in CH3) and C–Si;
#       Angles: all H–C–H combinations and H–C–Si angles.
#  3) Mode 3 (only surface angles): Angles at the Si center between any two functional groups.
#  4) Mode 4 (all): Both groups’ bonds/angles plus the surface angles.

# Example invocation for Mode 4:
echo "Running find_indices.py to extract H atom indices..."
python find_indices.py 4


Input and output filenames (optional overrides)
INPUT_XDATCAR = "XDATCAR"
OUTPUT_SPECTRUM = "output_average.dat"
