## Theory

This script extracts vibrational frequencies by applying a Fourier transform to the time‑series data of atomic trajectories generated by VASP molecular dynamics (MD) runs. In brief:

1. **MD Trajectory Output**  
   - Perform a VASP MD simulation and configure XDATCAR to write every ionic step (e.g., set `LWRITE_IO = .TRUE.` or use `NSW` with `IBRION=0`).  
   - Ensure periodic snapshots of Si, O, H, and C atom positions are saved.

2. **Signal Preparation**  
   - Select only the OH and CH₃ atoms (by their indices) from the trajectory frames.  
   - Compute displacements or velocities for each bond vector as a function of time.

3. **Fourier Transform**  
   - Apply a discrete Fourier transform (via NumPy’s FFT) to each time‑series.  
   - Convert frequency‑domain amplitudes into power spectra, yielding peaks at characteristic vibrational modes.

4. **Spectrum Assembly**  
   - Combine individual group spectra, normalize intensity, and output as text (CSV) or plotted image (PNG).
